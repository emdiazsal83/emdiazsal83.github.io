This work presents new causal discovery methods more suitable for the data regimes
typically seen in Earth system sciences. I addressed some of the main challenges of
non-additive, causal-insufficient, and spatio-temporal data as well as instantaneous causal
relationships in dynamic deterministic systems. I also developed tools for data where
interventions have occurred, but the variables and observations affected are not known.
Furthermore, we present a methodology to estimate a latent causal representation for data
from different interventional distributions to reduce the large discrete space on which
causal discovery usually operates.

The thesis is structured in the following chapters: 

1. Introduction
2. Non-additive data: The conditional mean embedding
3. Non-additive data an no causal sufficiency: Latent noise imputation
4. Robust convergent cross mapping
5. Invariant causal prediction
6. Discussion and conclusions
