I am interested in causal discovery, causal inference, machine learning (ML), probability and statiistics. Concreteley, I am interestesd in applying causal reasoning and probabilistic reasoning and statistical and ML models for applications to Earth System science. At a methodological level I have worked with and developed causal discovery techniques related to asymmetry bivariate causal discovery, [invariant causal prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01332) and convergent cross mapping. 

Appliications include species distribution modeling, change detection for deforestation and destruction of coral reefs, discriminating, with causal arguments, between large fires that will produce a Pyrocumulunimbus storm clouds and those that won’t, identifying spatial patterns of causal heterogeneity  for the water and carbon cycles. My current research is on learning efficient causal representations of confounding variaables, use of LLMs for causal discovery tasks and identifying the causal drivers of extreme heatwave events.
